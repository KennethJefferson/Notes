Supervised


In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.


Tasks
#
Unsupervised


the training data is unlabeled. The system tries to learn without a teacher.


Scenario


say you have a lot of data about your blogâ€™s visitors. You may want to run a clustering algorithm to try to detect groups of similar visitors. At no point do you tell the algorithm which group a visitor belongs to: it finds those connections without your help. It might notice that 40% of your visitors are teenagers who love comic books and generally read your blog after school, while 20% are adults who enjoy sci-fi and who visit during the weekends. If you use a hierarchical clustering algorithm, it may also subdivide each group into smaller groups. This may help you target your posts for each group.
