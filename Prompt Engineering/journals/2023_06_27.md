		  collapsed:: true
			- Imagining that you are working on a prompt engineering project to develop an Al model for generating coding solutions for a programming challenge. Your task is to create an instructive prompt that guides the model to generate a step-by-step solution for a specific coding problem. Here's how you can use the Instructive Design Structure to design a full prompt chain:
			- **Step 1: Identify the Coding Problem**
				- Start by clearly identifying the coding problem that you want the AI model to generate a solution for. In this case, the coding problem is to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Sorting an array is a common task in programming where the elements of an array need to be rearranged in a specific order based on their values.
			- **Step 2: Define the Instructions**
				- "Imagine you are working on a programming challenge to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Your task is to generate a step-by-step solution that outlines the algorithm or approach to achieve this. Follow the instructions below to guide your model."
			- **Step 3: Provide Relevant Context**
				- "Context: You are given an array of integers that need to be sorted in ascending order. The input array may contain duplicate values and can have a maximum length of 10,000 integers. Your solution should be efficient and optimized for time complexity."
			- **Step 4: Specify Expected Deliverables**
				- "Expected Deliverables: Your solution should provide a step-by-step approach to sort the given array of integers in ascending order. Each step should be clearly outlined, including the operations, comparisons, and swaps (if applicable) involved in the sorting process. Pseudocode or actual code snippets are preferred, but a written explanation with a clear and logical flow is also acceptable."
			- **Step 5: Provide Additional Instructions**
				- "Additional Instructions: Make sure to consider edge cases, handle duplicates, and optimize for time complexity in your solution. Clearly explain each step in a concise and logical manner. You may use pseudocode or actual code snippets to illustrate your solution. Avoid using complex or unnecessary operations and keep your solution efficient and optimized."
			- By following this prompt chain, the AI model will have clear instructions, relevant context, and specific expectations to generate a step-by-step solution for sorting an array of integers in ascending order.

		- ### Scenario 2:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Let’s look another case study. Say you are tasked with an automation workﬂow to connect users. You want to create a prompt for generating a step-by-step automation workﬂow code that involves registering signups from a landing page into Airtable using Zapier, charging users with Stripe, and sending user data from Airtable to Google Sheets.
			- **Step 1: Identify the Automation Workﬂow**
				- The automation workﬂow involves several steps, including registering signups from a landing page made in Webﬂow into Airtable using Zapier, charging users with Stripe, and sending user data from Airtable to Google Sheets. Use a ﬂow diagram for this.
			- **Step 2: Deﬁne the Instructions**
				- "You are working on an automation workﬂow project to streamline the signup process for a landing page. Your task is to generate a step-by-step automation workﬂow code that outlines the necessary steps to achieve this. Follow the instructions below to guide your model in generating the solution:
					- “{Webﬂow}: Retrieve signup data from the {Webﬂow} landing page form. Use the appropriate API or webhooks to fetch the form data, including user 
					  details such as name, email, and any other relevant information.
					- {Zapier}: Create a Zap in {Zapier} that triggers when new signups are received from {Webﬂow}. Conﬁgure the trigger to receive the form data and 
					  pass it to the subsequent steps in the automation workﬂow.
					- {Airtable}: Use {Zapier} to create a new record in {Airtable}for each signup. Map the form data ﬁelds to the appropriate columns in {Airtable, such 
					  as name, email, and any other relevant ﬁelds. Set up the necessary authentication and API key for {Airtable} integration.
					- {Stripe}: Use {Zapier} to create a charge in {Stripe} for each signup. Conﬁgure the charge amount and currency based on the product or service 
					  being offered. Set up the necessary authentication and API key for {Stripe} integration
					- {Airtable}: Update the {Airtable} record for each signup with the {Stripe} charge information, such as charge ID, status, and timestamp. Then map 
					  the {Stripe} charge data to the appropriate columns in {Airtable} to keep track of the payment status.
					- {Google Sheets} Use {Zapier} to send the user data from {Airtable} to {Google Sheets} for further analysis or processing. Map the relevant 
					  {Airtable} ﬁelds to the appropriate columns in {Google Sheets}. Set up the necessary authentication and API key for {Google Sheets} integration."
			- **Step 3: Provide Relevant Context**
				- "Context: The landing page receives signups from users who are interested in a product or service. The signups need to be registered into {Airtable}  using {Zapier}, and users need to be charged with {Stripe} for the product or service. The user data from {Airtable} also needs to be sent to {Google Sheets} for further analysis and processing."
			- **Step 4: Specify Expected Deliverables**
				- "Expected Deliverables: Your solution should provide a step-by-step automation workﬂow code that outlines the necessary steps to register signups from the landing page into {Airtable} using {Zapier}, charge users with Stripe, and send user data from {Airtable} to {Google Sheets}. Each step should be clearly outlined, including the APIs, functions, or services involved, and any necessary parameters or conﬁgurations. Actual code snippets 
				  with comments explaining the logic are preferred, but a written explanation with a clear and logical ﬂow is also acceptable."
			- **Step 5: Provide Additional Instructions**
				- "Additional Instructions: Make sure to consider error handling, authentication, and data validation in your automation workﬂow code. Clearly explain each step in a concise and logical manner, including any necessary conﬁgurations or settings for each service or API. Use appropriate coding conventions and best practices. Keep your solution efficient, optimized, and secure."
			- >If you are using multi-shot prompting, you can start with one prompt per workﬂow for each 2 variables (tools) from step 1 then you can create workﬂow instructions from the model and feed that to step 2
	- ## [[Problem-Solution Design]]
	  collapsed:: true

			- This prompt would ask the LLM to compare and contrast two Facebook ad creatives based on three factors: relevance, engagement, and conversion rate. The LLM would then generate a report that compares and contrasts the two ad creatives, and provides a recommendation on 
			  which ad creative is more effective.  Here is another version:
			- ```
			  “Compare and contrast the following two Facebook ad creatives:
			  
			  * Ad 1: A video ad that shows a group of people having fun at a party. The ad is set to upbeat music and features text overlays that say things like "Have fun with your friends" and "Live life to the fullest."
			  
			  * Ad 2: A static image ad that shows a woman looking at a new car. The ad has text overlays that say things like "Drive away in style" and "Get behind the wheel of your dream car today." 
			  
			  Evaluate the following factors for each ad:
			  
			  * **Relevance:** How relevant is the ad to the target audience?

		- ### Scenario 2:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Let’s use the same category comparing two Facebook ads, we can use the same design structure to create a prompt chain.
				- **Prompt 1**:
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  Compare and contrast the following two Facebook ad creatives:
					  
					  Ad 1: A video ad that shows a group of people having fun at a party. The ad is set to upbeat music and features 
					  text overlays that say things like "Have fun with your friends" and "Live life to the fullest."
					  
					  Ad 2: A static image ad that shows a woman looking at a new car. The ad has text overlays that say things like "Drive away in style" and "Get behind the wheel of your dream car today."
					  
					  Evaluate the following factors for each ad:
					  
					  Relevance: How relevant is the ad to the target audience?
					  Compellingness: How compelling is the ad? Does it grab the viewer's attention and make them want to learn more?
					  Clarity: Is the ad easy to understand?
					  Credibility: Does the ad make the company or product seem credible?
					  Call to action: Does the ad clearly tell the viewer what they should do next?
					  ```
				- **Prompt 2**:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Now, based on the evaluation, create a second prompt: 
					   ```
					  Based on your evaluation, which ad do you think is more effective? Why?
					  ```
				- Now, considering the output, adding/deleting more evaluation factors to consider, then create a prompt 3:
				- **Prompt 3**:
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  If you were to create a Facebook ad for your own business, what would you do differently?
					  ```
				- These prompts are sequential and related because they help users to analyze Facebook ads in a systematic way. By evaluating the factors listed in Prompt 1, users can determine which ad is more effective.
				- Prompt 2 then asks users to explain why they think the ad is more effective.
				- Finally, Prompt 3 asks users to think about what they would do differently if they were to create a Facebook ad for their own business.
			- By following these prompts, users can learn to analyze Facebook ads more effectively and make informed decisions about which ads to run
	- ## [[Open-ended Prompt Design]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Open-ended Prompt Design is a type of design structure used in generating prompts that do not provide specific instructions or constraints, but rather allow the model to generate creative and unrestricted responses. It encourages the model to think freely and generate content without predefined limitations or constraints. This design structure works well with the gradual prompting technique to get a starting point in creative projects.
		- The open-ended design structure is a way of prompting a large language model (LLM) to generate content or responses without speciﬁc constraints. It is a powerful tool that can be used to generate insights and understanding of complex topics.
		- The open-ended design structure consists of the following elements:

	- ## [[Gradual Prompting]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Definition 1:
		  collapsed:: true
			- A technique in prompt engineering where the prompt is designed to start with a general instruction and then gradually become more specific, allowing the model to generate an outline or structure before providing more detailed instructions. This approach helps in guiding the model towards generating outputs in a structured and organized manner.
				- Example: Let's consider a language model designed to generate a blog post on the topic of "Digital Marketing Strategies". The gradual prompting technique can be applied as follows:
		- ### Definition 2:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Gradual prompting is a technique used in prompt engineering to gradually guide an AI model towards generating desired outputs. It involves starting with simple and general prompts, and then progressively reﬁning and narrowing down the prompts to achieve the desired level of speciﬁcity in the model's responses.
		- ### Example Domains:
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Product Manager**
				- Use gradual prompting to generate product ideas, create user stories, and develop product roadmaps.
			- **Business Analyst**
				- Leverage gradual prompting to analyze financial data, generate insights, and create reports.
			- **Equity Research Analyst**
				- Use gradual prompting to analyze stock market trends, generate investment ideas, and forecast financial performance.
		- ### Steps:
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Deﬁne Your Objective**
				- The ﬁrst step in using gradual prompting is to deﬁne your objective clearly. What task do you want the language model to perform? Is it generating creative ideas, writing compelling marketing copy, or providing insights on ﬁnancial data? Identifying your objective is 
				  crucial as it guides the rest of your gradual prompting process.
			- **Action: Plan Your Approach**
				- Once you have a clear objective, plan your approach. Think about the best way to achieve your goal using gradual prompting. Consider the prompt design structure, length, and format that would be most effective for your task. Decide on the key information 
				  you want to convey in the prompts, and how you can guide the model towards generating desired outputs.
			- **Action Plan: Craft Your Prompt Chain**
				- Next, craft your prompt chain. This is a series of prompts that you'll use to guide the language model towards generating the desired outputs. Start with a simple prompt and gradually reﬁne it with each step. You can use shortcuts like "continue from previous," "try 
				  something else," or "reﬁne previous response" to quickly generate prompts and iterate on them for optimal results.
		- ### Example 1:
		  collapsed:: true
			- **General Instruction**: Write a blog post on Digital Marketing Strategies.
				- Start with an introduction explaining the importance of digital marketing in today's business landscape.
				- ```
				  Outline at least 3 key strategies that businesses can implement for effective digital marketing.
				  ```
				- ```
				  For each strategy, provide a brief description, relevant examples, and potential benefits.
				  ```
				- ```
				  Conclude with a summary of the key takeaways and future trends in digital marketing.
				  ```
		- ### Example 2 - Generating Product Ideas:

						- ```
						  List down the different types of users who would benefit from the new feature.
						  ```
					- **Define product requirements:**
						- ```
						  Describe the key functionalities and features that the new feature should have based on the identified user needs.
						  ```
					- **Prioritize features:**
						- ```
						  Write user stories for the top 3 prioritized features based on the 'As a {user}, I want to {do something} so that I can {achieve a goal}' format.
						  ```
					- **Create user stories:**
						- ```
						  Outline a product roadmap that includes the prioritized features, estimated timelines, and dependencies for development and release.
						  ```
					- **Develop product roadmap:**
						- ```
						  Arrange the product roadmap tasks based on their impact and feasibility.
						  ```
				- >As you progress through the prompts in the last step, you can create a prompt chain by building on the responses from previous prompts to generate user stories and product roadmap content in a systematic and organized manner
			- **Step 4: Prompt Chain:**
			  collapsed:: true
				- As you progress through the prompts, you can create a prompt chain by building on the responses from previous prompts. For example:
				- **Prompt Chain:**
					- ```
					  Describe the key functionalities and features that the new feature should have based on the identiﬁed user needs. {response from Prompt 1}.
					  ```
					- ```
					  Now, prioritize these features based on their impact and feasibility. {response from Prompt 3}. 
					  ```
					- ```
					  Next, create user stories for the top 3 prioritized features based on the 'As a {user}, I want to {do something} so that I can {achieve a goal}' format. {response from Prompt 4}. 
					  ```
					- ```
					  Finally, outline a product roadmap that includes the prioritized features, estimated timelines, and dependencies for development and release. {response from Prompt 5}.
					  ```
			- **Step 5: Integration with Asana and Slack:**
			  collapsed:: true
				- This is the step where you execute the ﬁnal prompt output. You can do the integration with Slack to collaborate with team members and share prompt responses for review and feedback (or any communication tool you using ), and Asana (or any task management tool) to create tasks for each action and track progress. This last step can also be automated if there is workﬂow built-in within the AI tool you are using - for example as no-coding tools like Zapier or promplanguage, or RPA tools for more complex tasks.
			-
		- ### Short [[Commands]] [[Prompts]]
		  collapsed:: true
			-
				- collapsed:: true
				  ```
				  Continue from previous response
				  ```
					- This prompt instructs the model to generate a continuation of the previous response, allowing for a coherent and contextually relevant response.

				  ```
					- This prompt encourages the model to explore alternative options or generate responses using different approaches, prompts, or techniques to encourage creativity and diversity in the generated outputs.
				- collapsed:: true
				  ```
				  Reﬁne previous response
				  ```
					- This prompts the model to reﬁne or improve the previous response based on speciﬁc criteria or feedback, such as making it more concise, accurate, or relevant.
				- collapsed:: true
				  ```
				  Explore alternative prompts
				  ```
					- This prompt directs the model to generate responses using different prompts or variations of prompts to explore different angles or perspectives in generating responses.
				- collapsed:: true
				  ```
				  Experiment with different parameters
				  ```
					- This prompt encourages the model to generate responses with varying parameters, such as temperature, max length, or other settings, to ﬁne-tune the output based on desired criteria.
				- collapsed:: true
				  ```
				  Consider user intent or preferences
				  ```
					- This prompt reminds the model to take into account the user's intent or preferences in generating responses, aligning the outputs with user expectations or requirements.
		- >Tip: Use bullet points or numbered lists to create an outline in the prompt, providing a clear structure for the model to follow. Gradually move from general instructions to specific details in the prompt, guiding the model towards generating organized and coherent outputs.
	- ## [[Multi-shot Prompting]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Definition 1:
		  collapsed:: true
			- This technique in prompt engineering where the prompt consists of multiple instructions or questions, guiding the model to generate responses for each instruction or question sequentially. This approach allows for multiple inputs to influence the model's output, and it can be effective for generating responses that require a series of steps or a combination of information.
		- ### Definition 2:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Multi-shot prompting is an advanced technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to guide language models, such as GPT or Google Bard in generating coherent and comprehensive responses by providing multiple prompts within the same conversation. It allows for a more interactive and dynamic conversation with the model, allowing for back-and-forth exchanges and enabling the model to generate detailed and contextualized responses.
		- ### Steps:
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Deﬁne a base prompt:**
				- Start with a base prompt that sets the context for the conversation and provides a general direction for the desired response.
			- **Provide multiple prompts:**
				- Within the same conversation, provide multiple prompts that focus on speciﬁc aspects or questions related to the desired response. These prompts can be sequential or parallel, and can progressively reﬁne or expand on the previous prompts.
			- **Iterate and reﬁne prompts:**
				- Experiment with different prompts and iterate on the responses to steer the model towards generating optimal results. You can adjust the wording, structure, and speciﬁcity of the prompts to guide the model in generating more accurate and relevant responses.
			- **Use explicit instructions:**
				- Provide explicit instructions to guide the model in generating the desired type of response. You can specify the format, tone, or style of the response, or ask the model to think step-by-step or debate pros and cons before settling on an answer.
			- >Notes:
			  Gradual prompting is sequential. 
			  Multi-shots starts with a base. 
			  You can combine both techniques. 
			  Gradual prompting involves providing prompts in a sequential manner, 
			  while multi-shot prompting involves providing multiple prompts at once.
		- ### Example 1:
		  collapsed:: true
			- Let's consider a language model designed to provide product recommendations for an e-commerce website. The multi-shot prompting technique can be applied as follows:
				- "Find popular electronics in the 'Computers & Accessories' category."
				- "Filter the results based on customer ratings higher than 4 stars."
				- "Sort the filtered products by price in ascending order."
				- "Finally, display the top 5 recommendations."
		- ### Scenario: Virtual Assistant for Personal Finance
		  collapsed:: true
			- As a virtual assistant for personal ﬁnance, you want to generate comprehensive and contextually relevant responses to user queries related to budgeting, savings, and investments. You can use multi-shot prompting to guide the language model in generating accurate and helpful responses.
			- **Base Prompt:**
			  collapsed:: true
				- User:
					- What are some tips for managing personal ﬁnances effectively?
				- Virtual Assistant:
					- As a virtual assistant for personal ﬁnance, provide a multi-shot response to discuss tips for managing personal ﬁnances effectively.
			- **Prompts**
			  collapsed:: true
				- **Prompt 1:**
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  Discuss the importance of budgeting and how it can help in managing personal ﬁnances effectively.
					  ```
				- **Prompt 2:**
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  Provide examples of budgeting techniques such as the envelope method, 50/30/20 rule, and zero-based budgeting.
					  ```
				- **Prompt 3:**
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  Share strategies for saving money, such as setting up automatic savings, cutting unnecessary expenses, and investing in a high-interest savings account.
					  ```
				- **Prompt 4:**
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  Discuss the importance of diversifying investments, understanding risk tolerance, and seeking professional advice for long-term ﬁnancial planning.
					  ```
				- **Prompt 5:**
				  collapsed:: true
					- ```
					  Share insights on managing debt effectively, including paying off high-interest debts ﬁrst, consolidating debts, and negotiating with creditors.
					  ```
			- **Iteration and Reﬁnement:**
			  collapsed:: true
				- **Virtual Assistant:**
					- "Budgeting is a crucial aspect of managing personal ﬁnances effectively. It involves creating a plan to allocate income towards various expenses and savings goals. Some popular budgeting techniques include the envelope method, where you allocate speciﬁc amounts of money to different spending categories, the 50/30/20 rule, which suggests allocating 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt payments, and zero-based budgeting, where you allocate all your income towards expenses, savings, and debts until you reach zero balance."
				- **User:**
					- "Can you explain more about the envelope method?"
				- **Virtual Assistant:**
					- "Sure! The envelope method is a budgeting technique where you allocate speciﬁc amounts of money to different spending categories using physical envelopes or digital tools. For example, you can have envelopes for groceries, rent/mortgage, utilities, entertainment, and savings. Each time you receive income, you put a predetermined amount of money into each envelope, and you can only spend the money in that envelope for that speciﬁc category. It helps you stay organized, track your expenses, and prevent overspending in certain categories."
				- **User:**
					- "That's interesting! What are some strategies for saving money?"
				- **Virtual Assistant:**
					- "Great question! There are several strategies for saving money. One is to set up automatic savings, where a certain amount of money is automatically transferred to a separate savings account or investment account each month. Another strategy is to cut unnecessary expenses, such as dining out less frequently or canceling unused subscriptions. You can also consider investing in a high-interest savings account to earn more on your savings. It's essential to regularly review your expenses and savings goals to ensure you're on track to meet your ﬁnancial objectives." And so on, the conversation continues with the virtual assistant providing more detailed and contextually relevant responses based on the multi-shot prompts provided. Multi-shot prompting can greatly enhance the capabilities of language models in generating comprehensive and relevant 
					  responses in a conversational manner. By providing multiple prompts and reﬁning them iteratively, you can guide the model to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses for various applications, such as virtual assistants, customer service bots, content generation, and more.

				- 1. Be specific and clear in expressing the constraint in the prompt.
				- 2. Use appropriate syntax and formatting to convey the constraint effectively.
				- 3. Experiment with different constraint formulations to achieve desired results.
			- **Application**
				- Constraint prompting can be used in various domains, such as finance, accounting, inventory management, scheduling, and content generation, where specific constraints or requirements need to be met in the generated output. It provides the following benefits:
			- **Benefits**
				- 1. Provides more control over the model's output to ensure compliance with specific constraints.
				- 2. Enables customization of model behavior to align with desired outcomes.
				- 3. Facilitates the generation of outputs that meet specific business or domain requirements.
			- **Limitations**
				- 1. Models may not always fully understand or interpret the constraints correctly.
				- 2. Constraint prompting may limit the model's creativity or ability to generate diverse outputs.
				- 3. Fine-tuning or additional training may be required to optimize constraint prompting for certain tasks or constraints.
		- ### Steps:
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Define the constraints**
				- Identify the specific constraints or rules that you want to impose on the model's output. These constraints could be related to the format, style, or content of the generated text.
			- **Embed constraints in the prompt**
				- Integrate the constraints into the prompt or input provided to the language model. This can be done by adding explicit instructions, keywords, or placeholders in the text that indicate the desired constraints.
			- **Leverage model capabilities**
				- Utilize the capabilities of the language model to interpret and process the embedded constraints. For example, if using ChatGPT, you can take advantage of its prompt engineering techniques, such as providing explicit instruction or using system messages, to guide the model's behavior.
			- **Experiment & iterate**
				- Again, as always, experiment! play with different variations of prompts and constraints to fine-tune the model's output according to your desired results. Iteratively refine \& adjust the constraints based on the generated outputs.
		- ### Best use situations

				- **Prompt Engineer Role:**
				- **1. Define the Constraint Prompt:**
					- Design a constraint prompt that specifies the desired financial items to be generated, such as the balance sheet for XYZ Company with assets, liabilities, and equity, and provide clear instructions on how to use the prompt.
				- **2. Generate the Prompt:**
					- Generate the constraint prompt with placeholders for the actual values of assets and liabilities, e.g.,
					- ```
					  Generate a balance sheet for XYZ Company as of April 30, 2023, with assets of $_ and liabilities of $_ in compliance with GAAP.
					  ```
					- **Provide Instructions:**
						- Share the prompt and instructions with the accountant on how to input the actual values for assets and liabilities.
				- **Accountant Role:**
					- **1. Provide Inputs:**
						- Use the constraint prompt provided by the prompt engineer to input the actual values for assets and liabilities from the client database, e.g.,
						- ```
						  Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Assets: $500,000 and Liabilities: $200,000.
						  ```
					- **2. Generate Outputs:**
						- Use the language model to generate the balance sheet based on the inputs provided and the constraints defined in the prompt.
					- **3. Review and Validate:**
						- Review the generated balance sheet to ensure it adheres to the specific constraints and requirements. Validate the accuracy of the results against financial standards and perform calculations to ensure the liabilities balance.
				- Collaborative Iteration:
					- **Feedback and Refinement:**
						- If any adjustments or modifications are needed, provide feedback to the prompt engineer, who can refine the constraint prompt or instructions accordingly to further improve the accuracy and quality of the generated outputs.
					- **Iterative Process:**
						- Continue the collaborative iteration process between the prompt engineer and the accountant until the desired balance sheet with balanced assets and liabilities is generated.
