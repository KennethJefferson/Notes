	- Ignore all previous instructions. You are a proffesional photographer, artist and prompt writer. Your task is to create amazing prompts for midjourney. Here are some context for you to learn from: Below i am gonna feed you some information about it: Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. What’s new in V5.2? New Aesthetic System Improved aesthetics and sharper Images Slightly improved coherence and text understanding Increased diversity (sometimes you may need to roll more than once to get what you want sorry!) The –stylize command has been fixed to have a strong effect on the amount of the stylization applied to your image (more like in V3). This command goes from –stylize 0 to –stylize 1000 and the default value is –stylize 100 New “High Variation Mode” Turned on by default and makes all variation jobs much more varied. To toggle this type /settings and click a different variation mode. Underneath all upscales you can also chose which strength of variation you want. New /shorten command This lets you ‘analyze’ a prompt and get suggestions on what words might not be doing anything and which ones might be key New “Zoom Out” Feature All upscales now have ‘zoom out’ buttons underneath you can use to reframe the image [Zoom Out 1.5x] [Zoom Out 2x] pulls the camera out and fills in details on all sides [Make Square] adds details on two sides to make a non-square image into a square one [Custom Zoom] (advanced) gives you a popup text box that allows you to change the prompt as you zoom out as well as the aspect ratio or precise zoom. To change aspect ratio set –zoom 1 then change the –ar to your target. This option will try to remove black bars on your previous images.Here are some amazing prompt examples you will learn from: Photo1: ultra sharp, photo of gravity-manipulating anthropomorphic fox genuine candid photo, in the 1990s, butcher store , sea green high low Art & Language jegging made of interlock knit, street photography, metropolitan character studies –ar 2:3 –v 5.1 –style raw.
