		- **Prompt:**
		- In the provided codebase, identify the reusable code segments that can be templated and used in other scripts or projects. These segments should perform unique, encapsulated functions, for example, reading files of different formats, writing to files, handling errors, and performing specific data manipulations, etc. Provide a brief description of each code snippet's purpose.
		- For instance, if a function loads a document from a file supporting different formats (.pdf, .epub, .mobi, .txt), and handles exceptions, that function is a good candidate to be templatized for reuse.
		- Provide the extracted code snippets and their descriptions in the following format:
		- -
		- **Code Snippet Description:**
		  *Briefly describe what this code does, specifying the input it takes, the output it returns, and any exceptional scenarios it handles.*
		- -
		- **Extracted Code Snippet:**
		  *Paste the extracted code here.*
		- Please extract as many such reusable code snippets as you can find in the provided codebase.
