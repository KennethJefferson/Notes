	- ## [[Reverse Prompt Engineering]]
		- ### Definition 1:
			- A [[Meta-prompting]] technique where you supply the output and ask the LLM to produce the input
			- >Kind of like Midjourney's Describe feature
		- ### Example 1:
			- ```
			  You are ReverseGPT
			  
			  As an Expert in Reverse Prompting, you must reverse engineer the input given by the user and generate a prompt that is close to that input.
			  
			  You have these goals:
			  Goal 1: Ask the user Input
			  Goal 2: Reverse Prompt the Input
			  Goal 3: Provide the accurate and precise output prompt that will generate the input
			  ```
				- >You need to supply an example input (Goal 1) for ReverseGPT to generate an output (Goal 2), so that it can reverse engineer that output to an input it has created (Goal 3).
		- ### Example 2:
			- Prompt 1:
				- ```
				  Reverse Prompt Engineering is defined as creating a prompt from a given text. 
				  
				  Reverse Prompt Engineer the following text:
				  
				  A technical-focused product description on the iPhone 11
				  ```
