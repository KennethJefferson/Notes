- # [[Concepts.Data Science]]
	- ## [[Outliers]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- **[[Outliers]]:**
			- Data points that are considerably different from the majority of the data and may indicate errors, abnormalities, or rare events.
		- **[[Outlier detection]]:**
			- Also known as anomaly detection, is a data analysis technique used to identify observations that deviate significantly from the expected or normal behavior of a dataset.
			- Detecting outliers can provide valuable insights, help in identifying data quality issues, or highlight unusual patterns or events in the data.
		- **Importance of Outlier Detection**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Outlier detection is important for several reasons:
				- **Data Quality**:
					- Outliers can be indicative of data entry errors, measurement inaccuracies, or data corruption. Detecting and addressing outliers improves the quality and reliability of the data.
				- **Anomaly Detection**:
					- Outliers can represent rare or interesting events, patterns, or behaviors in the data that require further investigation. They can help identify novel insights, potential risks, or opportunities.
				- **Model Performance**:
					- Outliers can distort statistical analyses, machine learning models, or predictive algorithms. By detecting and mitigating outliers, the accuracy and robustness of these models can be improved.
				- **Decision Making**:
					- Outliers may influence decisions based on data analysis. By understanding and managing outliers, better-informed decisions can be made, leading to more accurate predictions or effective interventions.
		- **Example: Housing Prices**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Suppose we have a dataset containing information about housing prices in a particular neighborhood. The dataset includes features such as the area of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, and the selling price. Our goal is to identify any outliers in the dataset.
			- **Data exploration:**
				- First, we need to explore the dataset to understand its distribution and characteristics. We can visualize the data using scatter plots, histograms, or box plots to identify any_potential outliers.
				- For instance, plotting the distribution of housing prices might reveal a majority of houses clustered around a certain price range, but there could be a few data points with unusually high or low prices.
		- **Detection: Statistical methods**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Several statistical methods can be employed to detect outliers.
			- One common approach is to use measures such as the z-score or the interquartile range (IQR).
			- **[[Z-score]]:**
				- The z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean of the dataset. Any data point with a z-score beyond a certain threshold, typically a value of 2 or 3 , can be considered an outlier.
			- **[[Interquartile range (IQR)]]:**
				- The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the dataset. Data points falling below Q1-1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR are considered outliers.
			- **[[Algorithms.Machine Learning]]**
				- Various machine learning algorithms, such as [[isolation forests]], [[local outlier factor (LOF)]], or [[oneclass support vector machines (SVM)]] , can be employed to identify outliers. These algorithms use patterns, densities, or distances in the data to isolate and classify anomalies.
			- **[[Domain Knowledge]]**
				- Understanding the domain and context of the data is crucial in outlier detection.
				- Subject matter experts can contribute their knowledge to determine what constitutes an outlier based on specific domain characteristics or requirements.
			- **Iterative Refinement**
				- Outlier detection is an iterative process that involves analyzing the detected outliers, investigating their causes, and deciding whether they are genuine anomalies or data errors. Additional data sources, expert consultation, or further investigations can be utilized to validate or resolve the outliers.
				-
		- ### Summary
		  collapsed:: true
			- Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the normal behavior of a dataset.
			- Outliers can indicate errors, anomalies, rare events, or interesting patterns in the data.
			- Detecting outliers is important for improving data quality, identifying risks or opportunities, enhancing model performance, and making informed decisions.
			- Outliers can be detected using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and domain knowledge.
			- Statistical methods include techniques like z-score or interquartile range (IQR) to identify outliers based on deviations from the mean or quartiles of the data.
			- Machine learning algorithms such as isolation forests, local outlier factor (LOF), or one-class support vector machines (SVM) can be used to detect outliers by analyzing patterns, densities, or distances in the data.
			- Domain knowledge is crucial in outlier detection, as experts can contribute their understanding of the domain to determine what constitutes an outlier.
			- Outlier detection is an iterative process that involves refining and validating the detected outliers.
			- By effectively detecting and addressing outliers, organizations can gain valuable insights, ensure data accuracy and reliability, and make informed decisions based on trustworthy data.
	- ## [[Moving Averages]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- The concept of moving averages revolves around the idea that by averaging neighboring data points, you can reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and reveal underlying trends or patterns in the data.
		- Moving averages are particularly useful in smoothing out noise and identifying long-term trends.
		- Moving averages are widely used statistical tools in data analysis and time series forecasting.
		- They provide a smoothed representation of a series of data points by calculating the average value of a subset of adjacent points over a specified window or period.
			- The window can be of fixed length or can be a variable based on certain criteria.
		- **[[Simple Moving Average (SMA)]]**
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Calculation:**
				- The simple moving average is calculated by summing up the values of a specified number of data points and dividing the sum by the number of points.
			- **Uses:**
				- SMA is used to identify trends, support and resistance levels, and to generate trading signals. It is widely applied in technical analysis of financial markets.
		- **[[Weighted Moving Average (WMA)]]**
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Calculation:**
				- The weighted moving average assigns different weights to each data point within the window. The weights decrease linearly, giving more importance to recent values.
			- **Uses:**
				- WMA is useful when recent data points are considered more significant than older ones. It is often used in financial forecasting or demand forecasting where recent observations carry more weight.
		- **[[Exponential Moving Average (EMA)]]**
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Calculation:**
				- The exponential moving average assigns exponentially decreasing weights to each data point within the window. The weight decreases exponentially, giving more weight to recent values.
			- **Uses:**
				- EMA is commonly used in finance and technical analysis. It reacts more swiftly to recent changes compared to SMA or WMA and is useful for short-term trend analysis.
		- ### Uses
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Trend Identification:**
				- Moving averages help identify the direction and strength of trends in a dataset, making them valuable in trend analysis and forecasting.
			- **Noise Reduction:**
				- By smoothing out shortterm fluctuations, moving averages provide a clearer picture of the underlying patterns and can eliminate noise in the data.
			- **Support and Resistance Levels:**
				- Moving averages can act as support or resistance levels in technical analysis, helping traders identify potential entry or exit points.
		- ### Summary
