  collapsed:: true
	- ## Writing data to a file function:
		- This code snippet defines a function that writes a summary to a file. It takes a summary and a file path as input and writes the summary to a file with the same base name but with a .txt extension.
		- ## Extracted Code Snippet:
		  ```python
		  def write_summary_to_file(summary, file_path):
		      base_name = os.path.splitext(file_path)[0]
		      summary_file_path = base_name + ".txt"
		      with open(summary_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
		          f.write(summary)
		  ```
- # [[Snippet]] [[Creating sentences]] [[Python]]
  collapsed:: true
	- ## Creating sentences function:
		- This code snippet defines a function that takes a list of segments and combines them to create sentences. It takes minimum and maximum word limits as input and splits the segments into sentences based on those limits. It returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the sentence number, the text of the sentence, and the length of the sentence.
		- ## Extracted Code Snippet:
		  ```python
		  def create_sentences(segments, MIN_WORDS, MAX_WORDS):
		      sentences = []
		      is_new_sentence = True
		      sentence_length = 0
		      sentence_num = 0
		      sentence_segments = []
		  
		      for i in range(len(segments)):
		          if is_new_sentence == True:
		              is_new_sentence = False
		          sentence_segments.append(segments[i])
		          segment_words = segments[i].split(' ')
		          sentence_length += len(segment_words)
		  
		          if (sentence_length >= MIN_WORDS and segments[i][-1] == '.') or sentence_length >= MAX_WORDS:
		              sentence = ' '.join(sentence_segments)
		              sentences.append({
		                  'sentence_num': sentence_num,
		                  'text': sentence,
		                  'sentence_length': sentence_length
		              })
		              is_new_sentence = True
		              sentence_length = 0
		              sentence_segments = []
		              sentence_num += 1
