		- ## California Housing Prices
			- [[Workflow]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- Look at the big picture.
				- Get the data.
				- Explore and visualize the data to gain insights
				- Prepare the data for machine learning algorithms
				- Select a model and train it.
				- Fine-tune your model.
				- Present your solution.
				- Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
				-
			- **Goal**
			  collapsed:: true
				- Your model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing
				  price in any district, given all the other metrics.
			- **Looking at the big picture**
			  collapsed:: true
				- First task - build a model of housing prices in California using California census data. This data has metrics:
				  | Metrics | Property |
				  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
				  | longitude | continuous |
				  | latitude | continuous |
				  | housingMedianAge | continuous |
				  | totalRooms | continuous |
				  | totalBedrooms | continuous |
				  | population | continuous |
				  | households | continuous |
				  | medianIncome | continuous |
				  | medianHouseValue | continuous |
				- These metrics represent values for each block group in california. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Board publishes sample data. We will call the "districts" for short.
				- **Given all other metrics, model should be able to predict the median housing price in any district.**
			- ### Step 1: Frame the Problem
				- Ask the client what is the business objective?
					- Knowing the objective is important because it will determine:
					- how you frame the problem
					- which algorithms you will select
					- which performance measure you will use to evaluate your model
					- and how much effort you will spend tweaking it
				- How does the client expect to use and benefit from this model?
			- ### Step 2: Frame the Problem
