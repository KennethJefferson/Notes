- New way of sorting learning content #fleeting
	- Conceptual:
		- No projects, just concepts (likely a fundamentals course)
	- Thinking Framework:
		- Provides strategies on solving problems (best practices, tutorial, design patterns)
			- Anything that isn't project-based, but has some sort of process, it will be filed here
	- Projects:
		- Real-world use cases, if a thinking framework isnt provided explicitly, it can be extrapolated
