- Challenges:
	- Learners often struggle with the higher cognitive load of [[higher-order thinking]].
		- Unfortunately, learners can interpret the effort and difficulty associated with effective learning as a sign that the methods are ineffective and choose not to use them.
		- This is known as the **misinterpreted-effort hypothesis**. In short, learners sabotage themselves…
- Becoming an expert is not easy.
	- It requires a deep understanding of a subject.
	- The ability to apply that knowledge in complex situations.
	- Organize knowledge into structures that allow for efficient thinking and reasoning.
	- SOLO and Bloom’s revised taxonomy provide frameworks for identifying [[higher-order knowledge structures]] and thinking processes.
		- However, learners may struggle with the cognitive load of higher-order thinking, choosing to use less effective strategies.
			- To overcome this, learners must be taught to improve their metacognition and self-regulated learning strategies.
