		- I have a new paradigm for learning, I'll describe it to you and you let me know if there's already a name for it, potential flaws, similar systems, etc. These notes are for me and for me only.
		- I believe in the 21st century, we should be aiming to memorize as little as possible. In the digital information age, we should be aiming to build, deep knowledge structures (top 3 level of Bloom's Taxonomy). I want to offload as much storage of knowledge as possible to PKM notebooks (Obsidian, Logseq, Notion, etc.) instead of our brains and use this information to build more complex knowledge structures.
		- Albert Einstein said that anything that can be referred shouldn't be memorized.
		- So how does learning happen?
		- Well we will build our digital knowledge garden in our choice of a PKM notebook using the Zettlekasten method ([[Atomic Notes]], Fleeting thoughts, Literature Notes, Permanent Notes) and then compose those building blocks into concepts, then workflows, then exercises, then projects, then thinking frameworks.
		- Then we will cross-pollinate the concepts, workflows, exercises and projects to synthesize new ideas for all 4 categories. The goal is to have a well pronounced digital garden in a domain and begin to creating automations at the project level (if possible).
		- So the steps would be:
			- Documentation (PKM notebook, bi-directional linking, Atomic Notes, Building block composition)
			- Synthesis of information (deep digital gardening)
			- Templates (Text Expanders to code/text generate workflows/projects)
			- Automation (Generates workflows/projects automatically)
		- Let me know your thoughts.
		  ---
		- Now I need a way to notate this information Zettlekasten Atomic Note style. Again, the idea I have is something like this:
		- Level 1: Atomic Note (will be mostly used for terms and definitions,
			- can be fleeting/random thoughts, a question/answer pair, etc.)
		- Level 2: Compose these Atomic Notes into concepts (could be laid out like MoCs in Obsidian, but it doesn't have to be), which includes, but not limited to:
			- term and definition (composed via block embed from the Atomic Note) <- The What How it works, its relationship(s) or opposition(s)to other concepts <- The How
			- When it is used/not used (best practices, anti best practices) <- The When
			- Where this concept is used/not used (best practices, anti best practices) <- The Where
			  	<add some of your recommendations here if you can>
			- Level 3: Create Workflows from level 2 and import othr workflow from other sources (ex. How to create a Neural Network)
			  	<add some of your recommendations here if you can>
			- Level 4: Project. Which will compose parts or all 3 other levels and even imported projects from other sources (Github)
			  	<add some of your recommendations here if you can>
			- I have yet to add a formal method to synthesize knowledge based on previous documented knowledge. If you have a method, I'd love to here about that as well.
		- So there it is, feel free to add, remix, criticize, completely rewrite this strategy.
		- Compass of Zettlekasten thinking (North, South, East, West)
			- You imagine one Atomic idea/concept in the middle and you go in 4 different directions
				- North: Where does this idea come from?
				- West: What's similar to this idea?
				- East: What's opposite of this idea?
				- South: Where can this idea lead to?

		- We will use [[Dr. Joel Chan]] 's [[Knowledge Synthesis Framework]] for this task.

				- In this model, we create and update four basic kinds of entities in the synthesis process:
				  collapsed:: true
					- **[[Question notes]]**
					  collapsed:: true
						- Question notes express an open question
							- (e.g., *“What is the effect of analogical distance of inspirations on creative output?”*).
						- They can be readily mapped to research questions in research projects.
					- **[[Synthesis notes]]**
					  collapsed:: true
						- Synthesis notes articulate a single, generalized idea, such as a claim
							- (e.g., *“Inspirations that are of intermediate distance from the problem domain strike the best balance between benefits for novelty and quality of ideas”*).
							- In some cases, a synthesis note can encapsulate a more complex single idea, such as a theory
								- (e.g., *“Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection”*),
								- high level argument
									- (*“Scientific observations are theory-laden”*)
								- or problem
									- (e.g., *“The demarcation problem in philosophy of science”*)
							- By generalized, we mean that synthesis notes should aim at something that is true of an *equivalence class* of instances instead of expressing a bounded statement about a single instance.
						- Synthesis notes can be mapped to citation statements in academic publications, which are typically generalized and drawing on more than a single source.
						- They are also similar in flavor to “claims” in the micropublications model
							- (although it can encompass more complex things than a simple assertion), and “permanent notes” in the Zettelkasten method.
					- **[[Observation notes]]**
					  collapsed:: true
						- Observation notes articulate a single, highly contextualized observation
							- (e.g., *“the finches on the island had different colored beaks after two generations”*).
						- When we say "contextualized," we're talking about observation notes that are tied to specific details like when it happened, who wrote it, and where it took place, rather than trying to describe a general truth that applies to a whole bunch of related things
							- (that's what synthesis notes are for).
						- The idea is to keep observation notes as close to the original facts or "the data" as possible.
							- They should be like the way findings are written down in the results section of a research paper.
						- We usually write these notes in the past tense to remind us when they happened, mention who made the claim where we can (to show it's from their point of view), and try to use less abstract language (to make sure we're focusing on the important details).
						- 3. Observation notes are similar to what's called "literature notes" in the Zettelkasten method or "lines of evidence" in certain argument models used in academic research like the SEPIO model.
					- collapsed:: true
						- Context snippet notes are used to jot down and describe certain details that help us understand the observation notes better.
						- When we talk about 'contextual details,' we mean things like
							- specific numbers
							- data points
							- tables
							- quotes
						- that form the basis for an observation. It also includes information like
							- who the authors are
							- when it was published
							- where it was published
							- details about the method they used.
						- These bits of information are key to understanding and assessing an observation note.
