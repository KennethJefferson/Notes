	- Level 1: Create [[Atomic Notes]] (One idea per block)
	- Level 2: Expand those [[Atomic Notes]] using the [[3D Zettlekasten Cube]] method, thus creating [[Atlas Notes]]
		- **North (Inquiry):** Determining key questions this concept addresses or solves.
		- **West (Similarity):** Identifying ideas that are similar or related.
		- **East (Dissent):** Considering criticisms, counterarguments, and dissenting views.
		- **South (Experimentation):** Planning and executing experiments or projects to learn more about the concept.
		- **Up (Branches):** Exploring different branches or specializations of this concept.
		- **Down (Concrete):** Investigating practical applications of the concept, successful uses, and real-world examples.
		- **Center (Integration):** Synthesizing the understanding gained from all directions, generating a holistic view of the idea.
	- Level 3: Compose [[Atlas Notes]] into [[Map of Contents]] Pages
		- Each [[Map of Contents]] page will have the following to every concept:
			- Term(s) and definition(s):
			- Key Elements/Components:
			- Key Characteristics/Attributes:
			- Key Questions/Problems Solved:
			- Counterarguments or Criticisms:
			- All [[Atlas Notes]]:
			- Workflows:
			- Exercises / Practice / Code challenges:
			- Examples and Case Studies:
			- Projects (Mine):
			- Projects (Reverse Engineered):
			- Reflection(s):
			- Gaps in Knowledge:
			- Similar Concepts:
			- Dissimilar Concepts:
			- Unresolved Questions:
			- Future Explorations:
